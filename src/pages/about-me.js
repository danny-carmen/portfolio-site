            I completed my undergraduate and graducate degrees and licensing in
            architecture and worked in that field for half a decade before
            coming to a realization. Rather than pondering on buildings, I found
            myself spending all my free time teaching myself how to code and
            working on programming projects. I was drawn to coding for many of
            the same reasons as architecture, design, creative problem solving,
            working within limitations. I decided it was time to make a change
            and pursue my passion.

            <br />I recently completed a boot camp through Bottega University,
            and I am currently looking for a junior position. I am excited to
            bring value through my unique experiences as an architect turned
            developer.

            developer, previously an architect. In my career as an architect, I
            have worked on and managed projects ranging from multifamily
            housing, historic preservation, government and municipal buildings,
            religious and even an arena. While in the architecture field I rose
            up from basic drafting to project management to being in charge of
            production technology and documenting and enforcing standards for
            the company.I am good at jumping into a project and coming up to
            speed. Time management, communication skills, and office culture. I
            love learning, putting pieces together, love working within
            constraints, clean coding, learning what that means. */}
